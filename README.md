# Simple Java Project

## Description

This project contains a simple implementation of a stack using java as well as another java class that includes a greatest common divisor method.
Two test classes with unit tests are also included
The purpose of this project is to be a simple sample project for an exercise sheet

## Usage 

#### Stack class
The Stack class allows you to create a stack of integers with a maximum specified size. Here are the primary methods:
push(): adds an integer element to the top of the stack
pop(): removes and returns the top element 
size(): returns the size of the stack
isEmpty(): returns true if empty, false otherwise
top(): returns the top element but doesn't remove it

#### MyMaths class

The MyMaths class computes the greatest common divisor between two integer numbers that are input of the gcd() method.
